Visualise shot accuracy in a 2D basket court heatmap

Well this is my latest one did not took that much time to create. Although I have some scaling and resolution problems when making it an executable.
The way it works right now is focused on the visualisation part moslty.
When the programma is run it will require the players names 
For each player a recording window will open where you can record all the succesfull and failed shots
When you are finished with all the recordings it will ask you which's player heatmap you want to see (right now it will consider only the succesfull ones)
It will also save the file as a png
